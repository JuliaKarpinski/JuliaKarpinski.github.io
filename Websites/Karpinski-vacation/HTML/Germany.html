	<h3 style="font-family: Courier New;">Landmarks and places to visit in Germany</h3>
	<p style="font-family: Courier New;">Within the stunning country of Germany, a popular tourist destination includes Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. As Berlin's most recognizable structure, the gate stands 26 meters high with a chariot and horses perched on top of the gate itself. Another beautiful place within Germany includes Neuschwanstein, a beautiful castle atop a mountain which outlooks the beautiful land behind with valleys, rivers, and towns.</p>
	<h3 style="font-family: Courier New;">Why I want to travel to Germany</h3>
	<p style="font-family: Courier New;">The main reason I want to travel to Germany is because my dad has traveled there while he was in high school and he always describes how beautiful the place is. I have never traveled abroad yet, and I want to travel to this place with him since he knows the best places to travel to within Germany.</p>
