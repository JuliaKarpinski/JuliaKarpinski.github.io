	<h3 style="font-family: Courier New;">Landmarks and places to visit in Tahiti</h3>
	<p style="font-family: Courier New;">Tahiti is not as much of a known place to tour, but it is not to be overlooked. Tahiti is known to attract many tourists because of its over water village. It is the highest and largest island of the Windward group of the Society Islands in French Polynesia located in the Pacific Ocean. Its clear blue water and different way of life attracts many tourists to this tropical destination.</p>
	<h3 style="font-family: Courier New;">Why I want to visit Tahiti</h3>
	<p style="font-family: Courier New;">I want to visit Tahiti for the reason that it is different from anywhere I have ever gone to. I look at pictures of Tahiti online and the over water villages with bungalows truly amazes me. I think it would be a truly memorable and unique experience to have, either with friends or my family I would be happy.</p>
