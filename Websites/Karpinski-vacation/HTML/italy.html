	<h3 style="font-family: Courier New;">Landmarks and places to visit in Italy</h3>
	<p style="font-family: Courier New;">In the country of Italy, there are many beautiful places to visit. In the city of Rome, you can visit the famous Colosseum, the famous artist Michelangelo's greatest art pieces in the Sistine Chapel, and some of the greatest authentic Italian food across the country. There is also the great city of Venice, where canals run through the city like roads, where you can take water taxis at any time. This unique city is another hotspot for vacationing.</p>
	<h3 style="font-family: Courier New;">Why I want to visit Italy</h3>
	<p style="font-family: Courier New;">Personally, I wish to visit Italy mainly because many people in my family is from Italy. I want to experience the culture of my heritage and where most of my family has traveled from. I also heard from my friend that Italy is a very beatiful and relaxing place to travel to. It is an opportunity to spend time with my family while experiencing new authentic Italian foods as well as breathtaking landscapes.</p>
